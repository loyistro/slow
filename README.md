# Pace

This theme is used on my [personal website](https://loyistro.github.io), which is running on Hugo, and it was not designed as a theme template. 

However, feel free to use it if you find inspiration, as it is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/loyistro/pace/blob/main/LICENSE).

For now, I won’t be providing guidance or adding new features I don't need (yet), as I prefer to iterate on this theme at my own pace. That’s also why this theme is called “Pace”.
